Project 1: Unscramble Computer Science Problems - Run time analysis

Task 0
Time Complexity: O(1) - Constant time
Reason: Operations take constant time to execute irrespective of input


Task 1
Time Complexity: O(n + m) - Linear time
Reason: Traversal through the lists of records of calls and texts


Task 2
Time Complexity: O(n) - Linear time
Reason: Traversal through the list of records of calls (at max)


Task 3
Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)) - Log-linear time
Reason: Traversal through the list of records of calls and built in sort function: (n + nlog(n)).
             nlog(n) gets precedence


Task 4
Time Complexity: O( (n+m) + n log(n)) - Log-linear time
Reason: Traversal through the lists of records of calls and texts and built in sort function.
             Precedence can't be determined till further investigation.
